Technical Stack Recommendations
Frontend Framework
Recommendation: React with TypeScript

Why: Component reusability, strong typing for data models, extensive ecosystem
Alternative: Vue.js 3 (simpler learning curve, excellent reactive data handling)

UI Framework
Recommendation: Tailwind CSS with HeadlessUI

Why: Clean, minimal design system, responsive utilities, accessibility built-in
Alternative: Plain CSS with CSS Grid/Flexbox (maximum performance, no dependencies)

State Management
Recommendation: Zustand

Why: Lightweight, simple API, TypeScript support, perfect for local state
Alternative: React Context + useReducer (no additional dependencies)

Local Storage
Recommendation: IndexedDB with Dexie.js wrapper

Why: Better performance for large datasets, complex querying, 50MB+ storage
Alternative: LocalStorage with JSON (simpler but limited to ~10MB)

Build Tool
Recommendation: Vite

Why: Fast development, optimized builds, excellent TypeScript support
Alternative: Create React App (more established, larger community)

Appendix: Implementation Notes
This PRD is optimized for handoff to developers, whether human or AI-assisted. Each feature includes clear acceptance criteria that can be directly translated into test cases. The technical stack recommendations prioritize modern, well-documented technologies with strong TypeScript support for maintainability.
The phased approach allows for iterative development with working software at each milestone. The data model is designed to be extensible without breaking changes, supporting the planned evolution from local to cloud storage.
